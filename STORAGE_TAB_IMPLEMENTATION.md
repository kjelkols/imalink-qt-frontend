# Storage Tab - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Storage View (`src/ui/storage_view.py`)

#### Main Components
- **StorageView Widget**: Main storage management interface
  - Split layout: Storage list (left) + Details panel (right)
  - Header with title and action buttons
  - Full CRUD operations for storage locations

#### Storage List
- Shows all registered storages from backend
- Status indicators:
  - 🟢 Green = Accessible
  - 🔴 Red = Not accessible
- Displays: Name, path, file count, size
- Click to select, auto-loads details

#### Storage Details Panel
Shows complete information:
- Display name
- UUID (selectable/copyable)
- Accessibility status
- Full path (selectable/copyable)
- Parent path
- Directory name
- Total files and size
- Created/updated timestamps
- Description

#### Action Buttons
- **New Storage**: Create new storage location
- **Refresh**: Reload storage list
- **Verify**: Check storage accessibility
- **Edit**: Edit storage metadata (TODO)
- **Delete**: Remove storage record (files remain)

### 2. New Storage Dialog (`NewStorageDialog`)

#### Features
- Parent path selector with browse button
- Optional display name
- Optional description
- Live preview of storage path to be created
- Full validation:
  - Parent must exist
  - Parent must be writable
  - Prevents duplicate folders

#### Storage Creation Process
1. User selects parent directory
2. System generates: `imalink_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_uuid/`
3. Creates directory structure:
   ```
   imalink_20241018_143052_a1b2c3d4/
   ├── index.json          # Master index
   ├── imports/            # Session indexes
   ├── photos/             # User files
   └── .imalink/          # System files
       ├── hotpreviews/   # Thumbnails
       └── metadata/      # Additional metadata
   ```
4. Registers with backend via FileStorage API
5. Shows confirmation with full path

### 3. Storage Verification & Recovery

#### Accessibility Check
- Automatically checks if storage folder exists
- Updates status indicator in real-time
- Works with local and external drives

#### Storage Relocation
When storage not found:
1. Shows warning: "Storage may be external drive"
2. Offers to browse for new location
3. Searches for storage folder by directory name
4. Validates it's a real storage (checks for index.json)
5. Updates backend with new path
6. Reloads and shows success

### 4. MainWindow Integration

#### Tab Order
1. 📸 Gallery
2. **📦 Storage** (NEW)
3. 📥 Import
4. 📊 API Stats

#### Signals
- `storage_changed`: Emitted when storage created/updated/deleted
- Connected to `on_storage_changed()` handler for future integration

## 🎯 User Workflows

### Create First Storage
1. Open Storage tab
2. Click "New Storage"
3. Browse to parent location (e.g., `/home/user/photos`)
4. Enter display name (optional): "Main Photo Archive"
5. Add description (optional)
6. Click "Create"
7. ✅ Storage created and ready for import

### Verify External Storage
1. Storage shows 🔴 Red (not accessible)
2. Connect USB drive
3. Click "Verify Accessibility"
4. Browse to new mount point
5. System finds storage folder
6. ✅ Storage updated and accessible

### Delete Storage
1. Select storage
2. Click "Delete"
3. Confirm warning (files not touched)
4. ✅ Storage record removed from database

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Storage Naming Convention
```python
timestamp = "YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"
uuid_short = storage_uuid[:8]
directory_name = f"imalink_{timestamp}_{uuid_short}"

# Example: imalink_20241018_143052_a1b2c3d4
```

### Directory Structure Created
```
imalink_20241018_143052_a1b2c3d4/
├── index.json              # Master index with UUID
├── imports/                # Per-session JSON indexes (empty initially)
├── photos/                 # User-controlled file organization (empty initially)
└── .imalink/              # System files (hidden)
    ├── hotpreviews/       # Thumbnail cache (empty initially)
    └── metadata/          # Additional metadata (empty initially)
```

### Master Index Format
```json
{
  "storage_uuid": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-...",
  "created_at": "2024-10-18T14:30:52.123456",
  "version": "1.0",
  "import_sessions": []
}
```

### Backend Integration
Uses FileStorage API methods:
- `register_file_storage()` - Create
- `get_file_storages()` - Read all
- `get_file_storage()` - Read one
- `update_file_storage()` - Update
- `delete_file_storage()` - Delete

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Import)
1. **Modify ImportView** to require storage selection
2. Add storage dropdown in import dialog
3. Block import if no storage exists
4. Show "Create storage first" message

### Short-term Enhancements
1. Implement Edit Storage dialog
2. Add storage statistics refresh
3. Show storage health indicators
4. Add storage browsing (show files)

### Future Features
1. Multiple storage selection for import
2. Storage migration tools
3. Storage templates
4. Cloud storage support
5. Storage sync between locations

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Edit functionality**: Currently shows "Not Implemented" message
2. **Statistics refresh**: File count/size not updated automatically
3. **No import integration yet**: Import still needs storage dropdown
4. **Backend dependency**: Requires backend FileStorage API to be implemented
